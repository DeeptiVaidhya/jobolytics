            </p>


            <p class="mb-4"><b>1. Misspellings and grammatical errors are resume killers.</b> Spell check then proofread by placing a finger on each word. Catching your own errors is tough . Try printing your resume out, changing the font, or copying it into a blank email. These strategies assist you see your words with fresh eyes, which may help with catching errors. Reading it aloud is an alternative choice for catching mistakes. Or, ask a career coach, friend, or loved one to review it for errors.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><b>2. Not including keywords that match the work posting. </b>Your resume should include equivalent keywords that appear within the job listing. If your resume doesn't have the proper keywords, it presumably won't get noticed because you will not appear to be a robust fit for the work.</p>

            <p class="mb-4"><b>3. An outdated resume will cause you to look obsolete.</b> Your resume should be updated and targeted for each job you apply for. make certain to update your skills section also as your work history. Check to make certain that skills, especially technical skills, listed on your current resume.</p>

            <p class="mb-4"><b>4. Including an excessive amount of information.</b> Don't tell your readers everything about each job. specialise in the highlights; keep your document to at least one or two pages unless you're applying for an edge within academic and research settings. (In that case, you would possibly want to make a CV in place of a resume.)Use formatting techniques like bullets and short paragraphs to reinforce readability. Limit your resume to the last 10 to 15 years of work experience. you do not get to include everything you ever did.</p>


            <p class="mb-4"><b>5. Writing a resume objective which does not match the work</b>. Avoid using an objective statement which does not correspond well with the main target of the target job. Many job seekers now leave an objective off their resume or use a profile instead. If you include either, confirm it underscores your interest within the sort of work that you're applying.</p>


            <p class="mb-4"><b>6. Including a career summary that does not match the work requirements.</b> Don't use a mismatched summary of qualifications at the highest of your resume. Your key skills within the summary should match many of the work requirements alternatively leave it off.</p>


            <p class="mb-4"><b>7. Writing position descriptions that do not show what you accomplished.</b> Avoid job descriptions which simply list your duties or responsibilities. Instead, write active statements which showcase relevant skills and accomplishments. confirm the employer can easily see how you added value in your role.</p>


            <p class="mb-4"><b>8. Leading your paragraphs with mundane or irrelevant duties.</b> Start with the toughest hitting statement which shows that you simply have key skills associated with the work at hand. Otherwise, your reader might just skim by that description.</p>

            <p class="mb-4"><b>9. Not quantifying accomplishments.</b> Avoid empty self-congratulatory phrases by quantifying accomplishments or providing other concrete evidence to support your assertions. Numbers, like people managed, sales figures, etc., are always helpful.</p>

            <p class="mb-4"><b>10. Being too modest.</b> Share any awards or recognition you've got received during a matter-of-fact manner i.e. "Promoted to associate director after increasing annual donations by 25%" or " Received team player award at three annual company-wide awards ceremonies." While you do not want to look boastful, your resume is the appropriate place to share accomplishments.</p>

Usually, if you're applying to a more conservative industry (e.g. banking) or continuing along a prescribed career path during which you've gained some experience (engineering, for example), you'll be wanting to use a chronological resume. A skills/functional resume works well if you've got little work experience, are entering a career that's very different from your educational path, or are changing careers.</p>

Be specific about what you probably did while participating in these activities and avoid a "laundry list" of organizations.</p>
